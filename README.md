# DEVELOP-BLOG-WEBSITE

WHAT EXACTLY WE WILL BE DEVELOPING? 


Blog website basically deals with the written content but in this project We‚Äôll go beyond just the text, we will make an interactive and a good user interface.  
SHOULD YOU START A BLOG ? 
In this Project we will use many Frontend Dev tools available(I‚Äôll guide you thoroughly what, when to use what) plus we will be also DEPLOYING this website & host it LIVE.  
Further, I‚Äôll leave it up to you that for what topic you will be dreaming to start this blog, and we‚Äôll discuss various things as soon as we beginüëç 

In this first phase of our project we will be making an awesome UI for our blog website, also deciding the name of our blog  MAKING THIE WEBSITE TO HOLD BLOG DATA The blog is of no use until it holds some user data, therefore we will be using JAVASCRIPT for learning how to hold data of our blogs. BACK-END ‚Äì NODE.JS Here comes the most important phase, developing a error-less back-end. We will use NODE as our back-end language also some frameworks of node.js. 

CONNECTING TO DATABASE AND HOSTING ON WEB 
As till now our Blog holds Data, now we will connect it with a Database. ‚Ä¢ MONGO-DB We will be using MongoDB Clusters for database connection the language will be JS for database communication with our back-end. ‚Ä¢ HOSTING THE WEBSITE Finally, our last step would be deploying our JS coded back-end onto servers, but for obvious reasons we can‚Äôt afford large noisy CPU serversü§û Therefore we host and rent other‚Äôs server(e.g. aws, GCP, Heroku, Bluehost and many more.
 By the end of this project we will have a fully working Blog.
